# zig-pixman

[zig](https://ziglang.org/) 0.11 bindings for
[pixman](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pixman/pixman) that are a little
nicer to use than the output of `zig translate-c`.

The main repository is on [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ifreund/zig-pixman),
which is where the issue tracker may be found and where contributions are accepted.

Read-only mirrors exist on [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~ifreund/zig-pixman)
